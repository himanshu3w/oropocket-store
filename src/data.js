    ques: "What is a blockchain oracle?",
    ans: "A blockchain oracle is any system that services a smart contract by providing it with data from an off-chain source or connecting it with an off-chain system. Oracles enable connectivity between blockchains and real-world data by interfacing with external APIs and data feeds, allowing them to pull data for or push data from a smart contract.",

    ques: "Why do blockchains need oracles?",
    ans: "Oracles enable smart contracts to interact with off-chain resources. Without oracles, smart contracts can only access data within a blockchain, severely limiting their potential applications. The majority of industry-changing real-world use cases for smart contracts require off-chain data and computation for proper execution and often an integration with existing payment rails to settle a contract. For example, a smart contract may require high-quality weather data from a reputable source like AccuWeather to trigger a transaction. It may also require the ability to pay out escrowed fiat currency through existing financial infrastructure, such as a bank checking account."
